          I built this website for many reasons: to showcase/practice my frontend 
          development skills, provide a place for people to see my experiences and get 
          a better idea of who I am, and give myself somewhere to document my newfound 
          love of travelingâ€“I recently went backpacking in Colombia, some of the pictures 
          from that trip are the background of this hero section.
          <br />
          <br />
          I hope this site helps to give you a good idea of who I am :{")"} !
