          Hi! My name is Owen Glahn and I am a software developer with experience in frontend, backend and embedded systems.
          I'm originally from New York State, but for the past four years I have been living in Montréal, Québec, where I
          attended McGill University. 
          <br /><br />
          Outside of programming, my hobbies include cooking, hiking, reading, learning about other cultures, and photography.
          The pictures you see in the background are actually film photos that I took on a recent backpacking trip in Colombia.
