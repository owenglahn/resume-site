          My name is Owen Glahn and I am a software developer with experience in frontend, backend and embedded systems.
          I'm originally from New York State, but I lived in Montréal, Québec from 2019 to 2023 where I attended McGill University.
          I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and work for SAP.
          <br /><br />
          When I'm not working on programming projects, I like to cook, hike, read, learn about other cultures, and do photography.
          The pictures you see in the background are actually film photos that I took on a recent backpacking trip in Colombia.
